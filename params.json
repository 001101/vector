{"name":"Vector","tagline":"Vector is an on-host performance monitoring framework which exposes hand picked high resolution metrics to every engineer’s browser.","body":"## Getting Started\r\n\r\nIn order to get started, you should first install [Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)](http://pcp.io/) on each host you plan to monitor. PCP will collect the metrics and make them available for Vector.  The pmcd and pmwebd services need to be running on each host, the latter of which needs to expose its tcp/44323 network port.\r\n\r\nOptional monitoring agents can also be installed in order to collect specific metrics that are not supported by PCP's system agent.\r\n\r\nOnce PCP is installed, you should be able to run Vector and connect to the target host.\r\n\r\n### Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)\r\n\r\nVector depends on Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) to collect metrics on each host you plan to monitor.\r\n\r\nSince Vector depends on version 3.10 or higher, the packages currently available on most Linux distro repositories would not suffice. Until newer versions are available in the repositories, you should be able to install PCP from binary packages made available by the PCP development team on:\r\n\r\n```\r\nftp.pcp.io\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr build it from source. To do so, get the current version of the source code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone git://git.pcp.io/pcp\r\n```\r\n\r\nCheck that prerequisites such as libmicrohttpd headers/libraries and\r\npkgconfig are installed.  Then build and install:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd pcp\r\n$ ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var\r\n$ make\r\n# make install\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore information on how to install Performance Co-Pilot can be found at:\r\n\r\n[http://pcp.io/docs/installation.html#src](http://pcp.io/docs/installation.html#src)\r\n\r\n### Vector\r\n\r\nVector is a static web application that runs inside the client's browser. It can run locally or deployed to any HTTP server available, like Apache or Nginx.\r\n\r\nTo run in locally, first clone the repo:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/Netflix/vector.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nMake sure you have Bower installed on your system. Bower is a package management system for client-side programming, optimized for the front-end development.\r\n\r\n[http://bower.io/#getting-started](http://bower.io/#getting-started)\r\n\r\nAnd install all dependencies:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd vector\r\n$ bower install\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can run Vector with Gulp. Gulp is an automated task runner and includes a development web server with live reload. In order to start Gulp’s web server, first make sure you have Gulp installed on your system:\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md)\r\n\r\nThen, install the dependencies and execute the default Gulp task:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm install\r\n$ gulp\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also run Vector with Python's SimpleHTTPServer:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd vector/app\r\n$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen open Vector on your browser:\r\n\r\n[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)\r\n\r\nAnd enter the hostname from the server you plan on monitoring.
