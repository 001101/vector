Vector is an open source on-host performance monitoring framework which exposes hand picked high resolution system and application metrics to every engineer’s browser. Having the right metrics available on-demand and at a high resolution is key to understand how a system behaves and correctly troubleshoot performance issues.

## Disclaimer

Vector is under constant development and new features should be released often. Bugs and issues are expected. We count on your support to find and report them! **Use major and minor releases for stable versions.**

## Versioning

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Vector will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
